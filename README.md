### About me! 👀
My name is Doilio Matsinhe,
I am an Android Developer from Maputo (A wonderful city in Mozambique).

On my free time I like to read([Mindsets](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322)💖) watch animes([One Piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece)💖), series and movies, chat with friends and play computer games([Mortal Kombat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat)💖).

### Experience! 🔭
Check out [Lobolo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lobolo.android) - An app built for a custom cultivated to this day in southern Mozambique. According to this tradition, the bride's family receives money for the loss that represents their marriage and going to another home.

I'm currently working on an App that shows a list of popular Movies and Series and their respective details. The list if fetched from TMDB.
Also working on improving my App [Cularte-Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doiliomatsinhe.cularte) an app to generate more awareness for Mozambican Artists. You can check out a few artists here [Cularte-Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/culartemz/).

In 2019 I was awarded a Google Scholarship in partnership with Andela and Pluralsight where I ended up becoming a mentor. Months later took the 8h exam and became an [Associate Android Developer](https://www.credential.net/4b207fa7-e080-4493-8e1f-5794a2cf6a18).

On the last week of March I ended up doing the [Android Basics Nanodegree](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/PKNCP76H), followed by the [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/HUN7KP45) in April.

On my quest to combine my passion for learning and teaching I have volunteered as a mentor on the [GADS 2020's Android Track](https://help.pluralsight.com/help/gads-2020) to help more people achieve their goals of becoming Google Certified. 

I am an open book so feel free and do not hesitate to reach out and connect on my social networks linked above, to talk about your experience or to simply send a **Hey there!** ✌😁.
