### About me! 👀
My name is Doilio Matsinhe,
I am an Android Developer from Maputo (A wonderful city in Mozambique).

On my free time I like to read([Mindsets](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322)) watch animes(One Piece💖), series and movies, chat with friends and play computer games(Mortal Kombat💖).

### Experience! 🔭
I'm currently working on improving my App [Cularte-Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doiliomatsinhe.cularte) an app to generate more awareness for Mozambican Artists. You can check out a few artists here [Cularte-Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/culartemz/).

In 2019 I was awarded a Google Scholarship in partnership with Andela and Pluralsight where I ended up becoming a mentor. Months later took the 8h exam and became an [Associate Android Developer](https://www.credential.net/4b207fa7-e080-4493-8e1f-5794a2cf6a18).

On the last week of March I ended up doing the [Android Basics Nanodegree](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/PKNCP76H), followed by the [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/HUN7KP45) in April.

On my quest to combine my passion for learning and teaching I have volunteered as a mentor on the [GADS 2020's Android Track](https://help.pluralsight.com/help/gads-2020) to help more people achieve their goals of becoming Google Certified. 

I am an open book so feel free and do not hesitate to reach out and connect on my social networks linked above, to talk about your experience or to simply send a **Hey there!** ✌😁.
